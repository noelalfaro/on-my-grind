Quiz yourself on Starbucks drinks. Can you be a barista? This is a web app built using React.js

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

In the required features for this project, you will have a form with multiple choice inputs that can be typed in and selected and their values will populate the answer box above them. Then when submitted, the answer boxes will turn red if the answers placed there are incorrect and Green if the answers are correct.

This is a lab taken as part of Codepath's Intermediate Web Development Course

## Notes

I had trouble using differenet notaion for passing down props at first, I'm used to just accepting (props) in a child component, I didn't know you could specify which props by name, it helps avoid having to do "props.example" in a child component.
